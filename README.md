# Robot-for-Land-and-Air-Deployment
This project involves the development of a robot that can transition between terrestrial and aerial modes of locomotion. The integration of a quadrotor with a wheeled mobile robot allows it to handle various terrains and obstacles. The design, testing, and results demonstrate the robot's effectiveness and potential for future applications in challenging environments.

## Hardware and Electrical Circuitry

### Control System

    Wireless communication via Bluetooth module.
    Arduino UNO for terrestrial operations.
    MPU 6050 accelerometer for flight control.
    Powered by Li-PO battery.

## Mechanical Parts Involved

    Planetary Gear (116 teeth, Module 2, Pressure Angle 20°)
    Spur Gears (15 and 30 teeth, Module 2, Pressure Angle 20°)
    Steering Mechanism (worm gear, spur gears, links)
    Chassis and Base Plate

## Experiment Setup and Discussion

The prototype was tested for its performance in both land and air modes. Control systems included the Arduino UNO for ground operations and the MPU 6050 for flight. An Android app was used for joystick control.
