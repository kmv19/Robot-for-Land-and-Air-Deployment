This project involves the development of a robot that can transition between terrestrial and aerial modes of locomotion. The integration of a quadrotor with a wheeled mobile robot allows it to handle various terrains and obstacles. The design, testing, and results demonstrate the robot's effectiveness and potential for future applications in challenging environments.
